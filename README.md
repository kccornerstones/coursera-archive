## Download all videos in all weeks of all lesson in one specified course.

- downloading from the old 'http://class.coursera.org' is easy since:
    - it is a simple html and can be parsed with html parser;
    - all links to the course material is provided in one page url;
    - you can use many popular software like 'DownThemAll' to download all the materials you wish to download;
    - there are many solutions already provided in github.com for this purpose;

- downloading from the new 'https://www.coursera.org' however is harder since:
    - it is javascript rendered and must be parsed using a browser engine, meaning: the html elements you want to parse may not be visible until you view it in a browser;
    - links to the course materials are spread within many page urls;
    - you will get tired of downloading after 144 urls;

- this compiled python gives solution to download all videos, subtitles and transcripts in:
```
    https://www.coursera.org/
```
- usage:
```
    jupyter notebook
```
